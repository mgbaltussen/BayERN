# BayERN

A Python package to perform Bayesian inference on enzyme kinetics data. 

Currently, the package implements custom Theano-operators to calculate steady-states of enzymatic systems. 
These operators can be used together with PyMC3 and implement full gradient support for the usage of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods.
